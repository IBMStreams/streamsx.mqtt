## Purpose of this toolkit

The streamsx.mqtt toolkit provides those operators that help you integrate IBM Streams with MQTT providers
like MessageSight or the MQTT services in the IBM Cloud.

This toolkit lets you read messages from subscribed MQTT topics and publish messages to topics.


## Introduction into this toolkit

This toolkit is split off from the [messaging toolkit](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.messaging).
For now, the MQTT related information found in the messaging toolkit is also valid for this toolkit.

**TODO:** The information from messaging toolkit must be reviewed and migrated to these pages.
