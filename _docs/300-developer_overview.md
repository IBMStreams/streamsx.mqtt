For development, the GitFlow branching model is used.

### Very brief description

The continuous development is done in the `develop` branch.

*Feature branches* can be used to 
implement features isolated. Feature branches always originate at the `develop` branch and get merged into 
the `develop` branch if a feature is worth to be merged back.

*Release branches* follow the naming convention `release/vX.Y.Z` and originate at the develop branch. They are used to 
prepare a coming release. When a release is ready to be published, a tag is applied. Release branches are merged into 
the `master` and `develop` branch.

*Hotfix branches* originate at a tagged version, for example at the tag `v1.0.0` and follow the naming convention
`hotfix/vX.Y.Z`. They are used to create fixes for released versions, when a a fix cannot be created as new release
starting off from the develop branch. The final release prepared in a hotfix branch is tagged and merged into the `master` 
branch if possible and into `develop` branch.
